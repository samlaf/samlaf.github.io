I'm moving back to jekyll (although reluctantly) from google sites. Although google sites is extremely simple and fun to use, its lack of support for latex and mathjax makes it cumbersome when it comes to technical writing.

## Reminders and Cheatsheet

Everytime I come back to this website after a little while wanting to add a new post or to change a certain feature I find myself needing a quick refresher of jekyll functioning. So here's are a few notes to my future self:
- Blogs are written in markdown. So you will probably need a refresher on that. I like this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Jekyll and Ruby Quickstart

{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec jekyll serve # test website
bundle exec jekyll build # build website
{% endhighlight %}

I finally understood these commands so I'll explain them here as a reminder. Bundler is the ruby equivalent of Python's virtualenv. So `bundle exec <...>` just means to run whichever command follows by using the gem versions specified in the local `Gemfile`. This creates a `Gemfile.lock` file which "locks" the current versions in, and will be read by future `bundle exec` calls. See [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/) for more info.

## Mathjax

To enable mathjax and typing latex, we just need to add a script tag with a bit of code under the default.html layout file. To do this, we need to overwrite the default minima layout, by having the local file in `_layouts/default.html`.
{% highlight html %}
  <!-- MathJax Script -->
  <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
    tex2jax: {
    inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],
    displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],
    processEscapes: true
    },
    "HTML-CSS": {
    scale: 100
    }
    });
  </script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
