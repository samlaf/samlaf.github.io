abstract: "In this short report, we attempt to give a (very) brief overview of manifold optimization. Manifold optimization’s goal is to generalize optimization from flat Euclidean spaces to the larger domain of Riemannian manifolds. Not only does
it promise to extend classical algorithms such as steepest descent and Newton’s method to a whole new set of problems, but also to rethink established solutions to classical problems, such as learning Gaussian mixture models, and in so doing outperform prevailing methods."
