title:  "Reproducing Generalizing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Neural Networks"
description: "IFT-6135 Deep Learning - Final Project"
date:   2018-05-21
abstract: "As part of the ICLR 2018 Reproducibility Challenge, we reproduce the results
from Learning to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (LÃ©vy et al., 2018), a
general-purpose method to train Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels,
parameterized by deep neural networks, that converge and mix quickly to their
target distribution. The code for all experiments is available [here](https://github.com/joeylitalien/l2hmc)."
