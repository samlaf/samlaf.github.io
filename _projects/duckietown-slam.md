title:  "Duckietown final project -- april-tags based SLAM"
date:   2018-01-11
abstract: "In this project, we wrote a SLAM algorithm for a duckiebot driving around [duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/) using [gtsam](https://gtsam.org/). Red arrows show the visual odometry, green arrows the optimized SLAM estimate, and green boxes the april-tags. After a loop-closure is detected, the SLAM algorithm gets optimized. In the video, we see the odometry drifting while the SLAM estimate corresponds well with the actual pose."
