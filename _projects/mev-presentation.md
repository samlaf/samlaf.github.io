abstract: "Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the extra money that block producers can profit from by reordering or censoring transactions in addition to the standard block reward and gas fees. When a user sends a transaction to the blockchain, transctions sit in a staging area called a transaction pool (txpool or sometimes mempool) where their contents are visible to everyone. Searchers and miners monitor this txpool to find opportunities to make extra profits. We explore their various strategies both for sensing and execution."
