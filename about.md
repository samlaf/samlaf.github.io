My name is Samuel Laferriere. For the past year, I've been doing academic research in robotics, developing [Koopman](https://fluids.ac.uk/files/meetings/KoopmanNotes.1575558616.pdf)-based control algorithms for self-driving cars and quadrotors. I'm currently looking for a job in motion planning or related fields. 

Prior to that, I completed my Masters degree at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms in Montreal, where I [developed]((https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9062604)) Bayesian Optimization algorithms for Neurostimulation. Before that, I was at McGill University, where I got my bachelors in mathematics and computer science. For more information, have a look at my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Samuel_Laferriere.pdf).
