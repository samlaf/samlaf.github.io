My name is Samuel Laferriere, and I'll be starting a PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) in September. I completed my Masters degree at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms in Montreal, where I applied Bayesian Optimization for Neurostimulation. Before that, I was at McGill University, where I got my bachelors in mathematics and computer science.
