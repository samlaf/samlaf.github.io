My name is Samuel Laferriere, and I'm a Staff Blockchain Engineer at [EigenLabs](https://www.eigenlabs.org/). For more information, have a look at my [Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/votufoi3afaeiwh/CV_Samuel_Laferriere.pdf?dl=0).

For those interested in my useless waste-of-time prior to January 2021 academic life, I was doing academic research in robotics, developing [Koopman](https://fluids.ac.uk/files/meetings/KoopmanNotes.1575558616.pdf)-based control algorithms for self-driving cars and quadrotors. Previously, I completed my Masters degree at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms in Montreal, where I [developed](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9062604) Bayesian Optimization algorithms for Neurostimulation. Prior to that, I was at McGill University, where I got my bachelors in mathematics and computer science.
