My name is Samuel Laferriere. I'm currently fascinated by all things blockchain and web3, and am open to interesting job opportunities or promising collaborations in DeFi. Please do reach out!

In January 2021, my brother and I started [RPY games](https://samlaf.github.io/rpygames/), an AR platform for drone gaming. We met the guys at [Orangead](https://oa.media/) and worked with them as head of AI and R&D for a year. Before that I was doing academic research in robotics, developing [Koopman](https://fluids.ac.uk/files/meetings/KoopmanNotes.1575558616.pdf)-based control algorithms for self-driving cars and quadrotors. Previously, I completed my Masters degree at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms in Montreal, where I [developed](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9062604) Bayesian Optimization algorithms for Neurostimulation. Prior to that, I was at McGill University, where I got my bachelors in mathematics and computer science. For more information, have a look at my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/votufoi3afaeiwh/CV_Samuel_Laferriere.pdf?dl=0).
