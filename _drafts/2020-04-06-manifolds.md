The formal definition of a (topological) [**manifold**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold#Mathematical_definition) is
> a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space.

Why do we need the two added assumptions *second countable* and *Hausdorff*?

Hausdorff is necessary because it implies that every convergent sequence has a single limit point[^1][^2].

Second countability is necessary because ...
