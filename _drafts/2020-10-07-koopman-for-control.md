Generally speaking, there are three problems associated to any dynamical system $\dot{x} = F(x,u)$:

- A **control** problem: given $F$, find $u(t)$ to get a desired $x(t)$
- A **system identification** problem: given $x(t)$ and $u(t)$ trajectories, find $F$
- A **prediction** problem: given $F$ and $u(t)$, find $x(t)$

We show, in turn, how Koopman can be used for each of these problems.
