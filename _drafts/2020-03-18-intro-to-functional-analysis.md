Functional Analysis, in a nutshell, is "just" infinite-dimensional Linear Algebra. With this in mind, anyone with a functional understanding of Linear Algebra will be able to reason by analogy, often resorting back to his finite-dimensional knowledge. There are however, unintuitive surprises that happen in infinite dimensional spaces!

|   | Space   | Linear Transformations | Dual Space|
|   |---------|------------------------|-----------|
|finite|Vector Space | Matrices        | isomorphic to itself|
|infinite| Banach Space = *complete* <br> normed vector space | Kernels | smaller than dual|

We have used here as an example Banach Spaces, which are just infinite-dimensional normed vector spaces, with the added requirement (when compared to finite-dimensions) that they are complete. Most of the infinite dimensional spaces with a specific structure have their own name:

- [Hilbert Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space) = Complete infinite-dim inner-product vector space
- [Banach Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space) = Complete infinite-dim normed vector space
- Complete infinite-dim metric spaces do not seem to have a special name
- [Frechet Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_space) = Complete infinite-dim topological vector space

Most of what I will be presenting in this post will be a rehashing of the hilarious and super informative introductory video[^1] by Dr. Peyam. If you haven't watched it, go watch it now.
