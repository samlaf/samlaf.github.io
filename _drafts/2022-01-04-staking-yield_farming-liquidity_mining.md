Where farming provides liquidity, staking does provide function and security to the network infrastructure.

We also need to look at airdrops.

Do all Liquidity Mining programs require staking??
See https://blog.synthetix.io/uniswap-seth-pool-incentives/
- "1. SNX tokens will be distributed based on each wallet's percentage of the liquidity tokens in the pool at the end of each fee period."

But https://defirate.com/synthetix-liquidity-incentive-tutorial/ this page seems to indicate that it required staking the LP tokens... maybe they later changed the strategy?

What's the difference between pooling, farming, and staking? They're all "staking" but locking up different tokens.
- pools stake a token pair
- farm then stakes the LP token received from pooling
- staking stakes the SUSHI token received from pooling+farming (potentially)

See also the [sushi docs](https://docs.sushi.com/products/yield-farming#simple-stacking-two-types-of-yield) to compare this "simple" two-yields strategy to the full-stack three-yields strategy.
