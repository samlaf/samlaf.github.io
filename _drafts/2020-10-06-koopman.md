Koopman theory, originally developed by Koopman in [1931](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1076052/), and extended by von Neumann in [1932](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1968537?origin=crossref&seq=1), introduced a description of [classical mechanics in terms of operator theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopman%E2%80%93von_Neumann_classical_mechanics). This perspective was already common place in quantum mechanics because of peculiarities of the quantum world that necessitated [non-classical formulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics#Mathematical_structure_of_quantum_mechanics), and although not necessary for classical mechanics, the hope was that a new perspective could bring about new insights and lead to new discoveries.

Although largely neglected as being a beautiful yet impractical theory ever since, Igor Mezic is often cited, [74 years later](https://mgroup.me.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/publications/art3a10.10072fs11071-005-2824-x.pdf), as leading its resurgence to the forefront of applied mathematics, casting a new perspective to Koopman by connecting it to model reduction ideas. Indeed, it wasn't too long after this foundational paper that connections to the [Dynamic Mode Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition) numerical algorithm were made [[1](https://hal-polytechnique.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01020654/document),[2](http://cwrowley.princeton.edu/papers/koopman_jfm.pdf)]. The Koopman operator, often also called by its more solemn yet semantically relevant name, the [Composition operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_operator), then surged in popularity. Mezic and colleagues summarize the theory and related algorithms in their 2012 [Applied Koopmanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3164) paper.

Although probably hard to digest for people without math training, more applied perspectives on Koopman theory have been developed in other excellent tutorials [[1](https://fluids.ac.uk/files/meetings/KoopmanNotes.1575558616.pdf),[2](https://www.mit.edu/~arbabi/research/KoopmanIntro.pdf),[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4408),[4](https://faculty.missouri.edu/~liyan/Coll.pdf)]. Koopman is now making way into [PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07076), [Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07647), [Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01568), [Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06850), and more. [Steve Brunton](https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/steve-brunton), of the University of Washington, is one of the leaders in this sphere. His "Data-Driven Dynamical Systems" playlist on youtube, where he explains Koopman, DMD, and related approaches, is well worth watching.

My goal is not to write just another Koopman tutorial. I recommend Brunton's [notes](https://fluids.ac.uk/files/meetings/KoopmanNotes.1575558616.pdf) for that. My goal is to share some observations and lessons learned while working on Koopman-based algorithms for robotics and control. Of course though, we first need to establish a shared notation. I will follow [Mezic](http://robotics.caltech.edu/wiki/images/3/35/ApplicationsSpectralTheoryKoopman.pdf)'s notation.

## Koopman

The driving force behind applied Koopman applications is turning a nonlinear finite-dimensional system into a linear infinite-dimensional system, which we can then approximate. We start with a finite dimensional dynamical system, $\dot{x} = F(x)$.
