## MakerDAO
"The Maker Protocol is not a lender. It neither owns nor holds the collateral or loan associated with a vault. It simply supplies the machine that allows people to lend against themselves – a novel and underappreciated innovation."

The weird thing about DAI (at least in its pre usdc-collateral era), is that DAI supply does not scale with DAI demand. DAI supply is primarily a function of an ETH holder’s propensity to leverage their position.

## Types of AMMs
- Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule
    - Augur V1
    - Gnosis
- Bayesian Market Makers
- dynamic pari-mutuel market makers
- Constant function market-makers
    - Uniswap (constant **product** market maker)

What about Compound: type of AMM that is not a CFMM because the interest rate function is dynamic based on the utilization ratio and the goal is not to keep the interest rate constant.
